# Web Development Quiz 

## Description 

	 This application is a webpage dedicated to asking basic web development questions surrounding beginner level javascript. This project will use a timer to determine your score deducting 10 seconds from your total time whenever an incorrect answer is selected. These scores are then saved to a highscore page where the top ten scores can be viewed at anytime by selecting the link at the top left corner of the page.

## Installation

This project can be viewed from the browser. 

## Usage 

This application is a simple 5 question quiz that is accessed via the browser. Once the start quiz button is clicked, the timer starts and the first question is provided. For every incorrect answer the timer is reduced by 10 seconds. Your final score is determined by the remaining time left in the timer after the final question is answered. Once the final question is answered, the test propagates a page that allows you to enter your initials. Those initials are then matched and saved to your score. If the score is within your top ten scores then the score is saved. If there are more than 10 scores already saved, the lowest score is then dropped from the high scores. The highscores can always be accessed via a link at the top left corner of the page.
